# @ink-feather-org/ts-utils

This repository contains various util classes for typescript.
As they do not have external dependencies and are rather small I decided to cram them together into this package.

npmjs.com does not support .adoc readme files.
For the full readme see [the git repository](https://github.com/ink-feather-org/ts-utils).
