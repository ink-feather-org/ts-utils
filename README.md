[Typedoc](https://ink-feather-org.github.io/ts-utils/)

This repository contains various util classes for typescript.
As they do not have external dependencies and are rather small I decided to cram them together into this package.

It provides a promise chain implementation and a async generator implementation.

npmjs.com does not support .adoc readme files.
For the full readme see [the git repository](https://github.com/ink-feather-org/ts-utils).
